# Ethereum-Beg
This is my first simple solidity program which consists of a contract and two functions to mint and burn tokens.

# Deatils
This program is written in solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain.
This program mainly focuses showcasing simple managing of tokens with two primary functions:-
     * nwmint: used for minting new tokens and assigning them to specified addresses
     * nwburn: used for burning tokens from a specified addresses if the address holds enough tokens

# Execution
To run this program, we used Remix, an online IDE.
we create a new file and name it however we want and save it with .sol extension.
copy paste the code from main file and click on compile from compiler tab
